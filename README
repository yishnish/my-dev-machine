To set up dev VM:

1)check out this project
2)install vagrant
3)Generate SSH keypair for the dev machine
Move them to the root of the project (don't commit them or they'll end up in the history and on github)
Add the public key to github
4)copy kerblasto ssh keys to the root of the project (it will look for id_rsa_kerblasto & id_rsa_kerblasto.pub)
4)vagrant up


TODO:
make VM accessible from host machine
is public network option necessary for VM config?
